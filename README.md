this project is the first project of the Odin project --> https://www.theodinproject.com/

in this project i'm going to build a frontend foundation by rebuilding google's home page in html and css.

one of the main tasks for me in this particular project, is not to look at other code that people have already written.

I am going to have to come up with my own solution from scratch to improve my coding skills along with problem solving abilities.

Let's begin...
